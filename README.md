## Overview
This repository contains the Silly Song app project for the **Swift for Developers** course in Udacity's [iOS Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003).

The Silly Song app lets the user enter their name, and the app then generates and displays a wacky set of song lyrics based on the user's name.
